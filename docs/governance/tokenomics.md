# Tokenomics

## Overview

Circle Layer's tokenomics model is designed to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. The current testnet provides insight into the economic mechanisms that will support the network.

## Current Testnet Token Information

### Token Details
- **Token Symbol**: CLAYER
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Testnet Total Supply**: 10 Billion CLAYER
- **Chain ID**: 28525
- **Network**: Circle Layer Testnet

### Current Economic Parameters
- **Minimum Gas Price**: 0.000021 CLAYER (1 Gwei)
- **Block Gas Limit**: 10,000,000,000,000 per block
- **Validator Minimum Stake**: 100,000 CLAYER
- **Faucet Distribution**: 1 CLAYER per day per address

## Validator Economics

### Staking Requirements
- **Minimum Stake**: 100,000 CLAYER
- **Staking Method**: Currently manual process
- **Validator Network**: Minimum 5 active validators required
- **Rewards**: CLAYER tokens

### Network Security
- **Consensus**: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- **Security Model**: Standard EVM + DPoS consensus
- **Minimum Validators**: 5 active validators for network security

## Fee Structure

### Gas Economics
- **Gas Price Calculation**: Standard Ethereum method (gas price Ã— gas amount)
- **Base Gas Price**: 0.000000001 CLAYER (1 Gwei)
- **Minimum Gas Price**: 0.000021 CLAYER
- **Fee Payment**: CLAYER tokens

### Fee Distribution
- **Burn Mechanism**: 25% from gas fees
- **Maximum Burn Limit**: 1,000,000 CLAYER
- **Validator Rewards**: CLAYER tokens
- **Treasury**: From faucet wallet distribution

## ðŸš§ Features in Development

### Automated Staking System
The following tokenomics features are currently in development:

**Smart Contract Staking**
- Automated staking contracts (replacing manual process)
- Smart contract-based delegation system
- Automated reward distribution
- Slashing conditions implementation

**Enhanced Economics**
- Dynamic fee structures
- Advanced burn mechanisms
- Governance token mechanics
- Cross-chain token economics

### Governance Integration
- **On-chain Governance**: Voting and proposal systems in development
- **Token-based Voting**: CLAYER-based governance rights
- **Delegation Mechanisms**: Stake delegation for governance
- **Treasury Management**: Community-controlled treasury

## Network Operations

### Current Testnet Metrics
- **Network Uptime**: 99.95% (Last 30 days)
- **Block Time**: 3 seconds
- **Transaction Finality**: 1-3 seconds
- **Energy Efficiency**: 99.9% less than Proof of Work

### Token Distribution (Testnet)
- **Faucet**: Daily distribution of 1 CLAYER per address
- **Treasury Wallet**: Distribution source for testnet tokens
- **Validator Staking**: Manual 100,000 CLAYER requirement
- **Testing Supply**: 10 Billion CLAYER available for testing

## Economic Incentives

### Validator Incentives
- **CLAYER Rewards**: Earned through block validation
- **Network Security**: Stake-based security model
- **Performance Requirements**: 24/7 uptime expectations
- **Hardware Requirements**: Modest requirements (8GB RAM minimum)

### Developer Incentives
- **Free Testnet Tokens**: Daily faucet distribution
- **Low Gas Costs**: Affordable testing environment
- **Example Contracts**: Reference implementation at 0xfCb4Ce5953dE22cbF04d015df88a3a9895E86bEB
- **Development Tools**: Full EVM compatibility

## Future Economic Model

### Planned Features
The following economic features are planned for future releases:

**Enhanced Tokenomics**
- Advanced staking mechanisms
- Governance-based fee adjustments
- Cross-chain economic models
- Oracle-based pricing mechanisms

**Ecosystem Growth**
- DeFi protocol incentives
- Developer grant programs
- Community governance participation
- Network effect economics

### Migration Path
- Current testnet economics provide testing ground
- Lessons learned will inform mainnet economics
- Community feedback integration
- Security audit requirements

## Integration Economics

### For Developers
- **Gas Costs**: Predictable CLAYER-based fees
- **Testing**: Free testnet environment
- **Tools**: Standard EVM development costs
- **Migration**: Minimal costs from other EVM chains

### For Users
- **Transaction Costs**: Low CLAYER fees
- **Wallet Setup**: Standard EVM wallet compatibility
- **Token Acquisition**: Faucet for testing, future exchanges for mainnet
- **Network Access**: Standard EVM interaction patterns
