# Tokenomics

## Overview

Circle Layer's tokenomics model is designed to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. The current testnet provides insight into the economic mechanisms that will support the network.

## Economic Model

### Endogenous Token System
Circle Layer uses **CLAYER** as its native endogenous token that powers all network operations:

- **Transaction Fees**: All transactions consume CLAYER as gas fees
- **Network Security**: Validators must pledge CLAYER to participate in consensus
- **Reward Distribution**: Gas fees are distributed according to stake proportion
- **Economic Incentives**: Stake-weighted participation in network governance

### Validator Economics Model
The Circle Layer network operates on a stake-based validator system:

1. **Validator Participation**: Miners pledge CLAYER to become validator nodes
2. **Reward Distribution**: Node rewards come from gas fees, distributed according to mortgage (stake) proportion
3. **Proportional Rewards**: Higher stake = higher share of network fees
4. **Economic Security**: Validator incentives align with network security

### Meta-Transaction Functionality
Circle Layer implements advanced gas fee optimization:

- **Gas Fee Reduction**: Meta-transaction function reduces overall network costs
- **Step-wise Reduction**: Users holding CLAYER receive graduated gas fee discounts
- **Developer Benefits**: Reduced costs for developers deploying and operating dApps
- **User Experience**: Lower barriers to entry for end users

## Current Testnet Token Information

### Token Details
- **Token Symbol**: CLAYER
- **Token Type**: Endogenous network token
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Testnet Total Supply**: 10 Billion CLAYER
- **Mainnet Total Supply**: 1 Billion CLAYER
- **Chain ID**: 28525
- **Network**: Circle Layer Testnet

### Current Economic Parameters
- **Minimum Gas Price**: 0.000021 CLAYER (1 Gwei)
- **Block Gas Limit**: 10,000,000,000,000 per block
- **Testnet Validator Minimum Stake**: 32 CLAYER
- **Mainnet Validator Minimum Stake**: 100,000 CLAYER
- **Delegator Minimum Stake**: 32 CLAYER
- **Maximum Validators**: 21 (testnet), 10,000 (mainnet)
- **Faucet Distribution**: 1 CLAYER per day per address

## Validator Economics

### Staking Requirements
- **Testnet Validator Minimum Stake**: 32 CLAYER
- **Mainnet Validator Minimum Stake**: 100,000 CLAYER
- **Delegator Minimum Stake**: 32 CLAYER
- **Maximum Validators**: 21 (testnet), 10,000 (mainnet)
- **Staking Method**: Currently manual process
- **Rewards**: CLAYER tokens from gas fees

### Stake-Based Reward Distribution
The network distributes rewards based on proportional stake holdings:

- **Gas Fee Collection**: All transaction fees paid in CLAYER
- **Proportional Distribution**: Rewards distributed according to validator stake percentage
- **Delegation Support**: Delegators share in validator rewards proportionally
- **Economic Alignment**: Higher stake = higher reward share + higher security responsibility

### Network Security
- **Consensus**: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- **Security Model**: Stake-weighted consensus with economic penalties
- **Minimum Validators**: 5 active validators for network security
- **Maximum Validators**: 21 (testnet), 10,000 (mainnet)
- **Economic Security**: Validators risk staked CLAYER for misbehavior

## Fee Structure

### Gas Economics
- **Gas Price Calculation**: Standard Ethereum method (gas price Ã— gas amount)
- **Base Gas Price**: 0.000000001 CLAYER (1 Gwei)
- **Minimum Gas Price**: 0.000021 CLAYER
- **Fee Payment**: CLAYER tokens only
- **Meta-Transaction Benefits**: Reduced effective costs for CLAYER holders

### Fee Distribution Model
Circle Layer implements a stake-weighted fee distribution system:

- **Delegator Rewards**: 45% from gas fees (distributed by stake proportion)
- **Validator Rewards**: 30% from gas fees (distributed by stake proportion)
- **Burn Mechanism**: 25% from gas fees (deflationary pressure)
- **Maximum Burn Limit**: 1,000,000 CLAYER (burning stops after this threshold)
- **Proportional Allocation**: All distributions based on stake percentage

### Meta-Transaction Gas Optimization
Advanced gas fee reduction mechanisms:

- **CLAYER Holder Benefits**: Step-wise gas fee reduction for token holders
- **Developer Cost Reduction**: Lower operational costs for dApp deployment
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Reduced transaction costs improve adoption
- **Network Efficiency**: Optimized resource utilization across the network
