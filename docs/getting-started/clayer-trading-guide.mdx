:::warning TEMPORARY LAUNCH RESTRICTIONS
🕐 **These purchase limits are ONLY active for the first 60 minutes after launch!**

After the initial 1-hour period, all wallet restrictions are automatically removed and you can trade freely without any purchase limits. These anti-sniper measures ensure fair distribution during the critical launch window only.
:::

:::info PROGRESSIVE TRADING FEES
📈 **Trading fees start higher during launch and automatically decrease over time!**

Launch fees begin at 30% (first minute) and reduce to 5% after 1 hour. Post-launch, fees progressively decrease based on project milestones from 5% → 4% → 3% → 0% permanently. This ensures project funding while protecting long-term holders with eventual fee-free trading.

## 🛡️ Anti-Sniper Protection

Circle Layer implements **automatic purchase limits** during launch to ensure fair distribution and prevent bot sniping.

### Why These Limits Exist
- **Prevent transaction failures** - Buying more than allowed will cause your transaction to fail
- **Fair distribution** - Everyone gets equal opportunity to participate  
- **Anti-bot protection** - Prevents automated sniping attacks
- **Network stability** - Manages initial trading volume

## 📋 Buying Strategy

### ✅ **Recommended Approach**
1. **Check the time** since launch started
2. **Buy within limits** for your time window
3. **Wait for next phase** if you want to buy more
4. **Monitor gas fees** - higher during peak times

### ❌ **Common Mistakes**
- Trying to buy maximum amount in first minute
- Not checking current time phase before buying
- Attempting multiple large purchases quickly
- Ignoring wallet limit warnings
- Not verifying the contract address
- Not updating slippage, gas, etc.

## 🔢 Exact Purchase Limits

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 CLAYER

- **First minute**: Max 0.10% = **1,000,000 tokens**
- **2-5 minutes**: Max 0.15% = **1,500,000 tokens**  
- **6-8 minutes**: Max 0.20% = **2,000,000 tokens**
- **9-15 minutes**: Max 0.30% = **3,000,000 tokens**
- **16-60 minutes**: Max 0.50% = **5,000,000 tokens**
- **After 1 hour**: **No wallet limits**

## ⚠️ Transaction Failure Prevention

### Why Transactions Fail
- **Exceeding wallet limit** for current time period
- **Network congestion** during high activity
- **Insufficient gas** for transaction processing
- **Slippage tolerance** set too low

### How to Avoid Failures
1. **Stay within limits** - Check your current phase
2. **Use adequate gas** - Don't use "slow" gas settings

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Best Practice
- **Start small** in early phases
- **Scale up** as limits increase
- **Monitor the clock** - know exactly when phases change
- **Have backup plan** - be ready for network congestion
