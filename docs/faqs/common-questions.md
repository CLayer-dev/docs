## Technical Questions

### How do I connect to Circle Layer testnet?
*Configuration for when testnet becomes available:*

```javascript
// Using ethers.js
// const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc-testnet.circlelayer.com');

// Network configuration for MetaMask
{
  chainId: '0x6F75', // 28525 in hex
  chainName: 'Circle Layer Testnet',
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: 'CLAYER',
    symbol: 'CLAYER',
    decimals: 18
  },
  // rpcUrls: ['https://rpc-testnet.circlelayer.com'],
  // blockExplorerUrls: ['https://explorer-testnet.circlelayer.com/']
  rpcUrls: ['*Coming soon*'],
  blockExplorerUrls: ['*Coming soon*']
}
```

### What wallets are supported?
- **MetaMask** (Recommended with testnet configuration)
- **WalletConnect** (Register and follow their guidelines)
- **Custom Wallets** (Same as EVM integration)
- **Mobile Wallets** (Same as EVM integration)

### How do I get testnet tokens?
*When testnet launches, the faucet will be available with the following process:*

<!-- 1. Visit the faucet: https://faucet.circlelayer.com -->
1. Visit the faucet: *Coming soon*
2. Paste your EVM wallet address
3. Click "Get 1 CLAYER coin"
4. Wait 24 hours between requests (1 CLAYER per day limit)

## Development Questions

### How do I deploy a smart contract?
See our [Deployment Guide](/docs/development/deploying-contracts) with Hardhat and Truffle configurations for Circle Layer testnet.

### What development tools are available?
- **Hardhat** (with Circle Layer testnet configuration)
- **Truffle** (with CLAYER gas settings)
- **Remix** (using Injected Provider - MetaMask)
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js** (standard EVM integration)

### How do I interact with contracts?
See our [Web3 Integration Guide](/docs/development/web3-integration) for detailed instructions. 
<!-- Example contract when testnet is live: 0xfCb4Ce5953dE22cbF04d015df88a3a9895E86bEB -->

### What are the gas requirements?
- **Minimum Gas Price**: 0.000021 CLAYER
- **Block Gas Limit**: 10,000,000,000,000 per block
- **Fee Calculation**: gas price Ã— gas amount (Ethereum standard)

## Security Questions

### What security features are implemented?
- **DPoS Consensus**: Delegated Proof of Stake security model  
- **Multi-Layer Security**: Network, validator, and transaction-level protection
- **Economic Security**: Token burn mechanism (25% of transaction fees)
- **Network Requirements**: Minimum 5 active validators for security

### What security features are coming in Phase 2?

### How do I report security issues?
- Use our bug bounty program
- Contact security team
- Follow responsible disclosure protocols

## Network Questions

### How do I become a validator?
See our [Validator Guide](/docs/nodes-validation/becoming-validator)

### What can validators earn?
**Revenue Sources:**
- **Block Rewards**: 2 CLAYER per block + performance bonuses
- **Transaction Fees**: 50% of network transaction fees
- **Delegation Commission**: 5-20% from delegated stakes

**Expected Annual Revenue (estimates):**
