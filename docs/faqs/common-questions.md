- **Testnet Validator Minimum Stake**: 32 CLAYER
- **Mainnet Validator Minimum Stake**: 100,000 CLAYER
- **Delegator Minimum Stake**: 32 CLAYER
- **Maximum Validators**: 21 (testnet), 10,000 (mainnet)

### When will testnet be available?

### What makes Core Layer economically secure?

Core Layer's economic security is built on several mechanisms:

- **Stake-based Consensus**: Validators must stake CLAYER tokens to participate
- **Economic Incentives**: Validators earn rewards proportional to their stake
- **Punishment System**: Poor performance results in slashing and income loss
- **Economic Security**: Token burn mechanism (25% of transaction fees) *[Mainnet only]*

### How does the fee distribution work?

Core Layer implements a sophisticated fee distribution system:

- **Delegator Rewards**: 45% from gas fees (distributed by stake proportion)
- **Validator Rewards**: 30% from gas fees (distributed by stake proportion)
- **Burn Mechanism**: 25% of gas fees (stops at 1,000,000 CLAYER threshold) *[Mainnet only]*
- **Proportional Distribution**: All rewards based on stake percentage

*Note: The ETH token launch uses a simplified model with 5% trading fees. Full fee distribution and burn mechanisms will be implemented on mainnet migration.*
