- âœ… EVM compatibility layer
- âœ… Basic AI security framework
- ðŸ”„ Network optimization
- ðŸ“‹ Performance testing

### Developer Tools
- âœ… RPC endpoints
- âœ… Web3 library support
- ðŸ”„ Developer documentation
- ðŸ“‹ SDK development
- ðŸ“‹ Testing frameworks

### Validator Network
- âœ… Validator node software
- ðŸ”„ Staking mechanism
- ðŸ“‹ Delegation system
- ðŸ“‹ Reward distribution
- ðŸ“‹ Slashing conditions

## Features Included

### Network Capabilities
- **TPS**: 2,000 transactions per second
- **Block Time**: 2 seconds
- **Finality**: < 10 seconds
- **Gas Fees**: Minimal (testnet)

### AI Security

- Test staking mechanisms
- Participate in governance
- Help secure the network

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 100+ active validators
- [ ] 1,000+ deployed contracts
- [ ] 50+ active developers
- [ ] 99.9% network uptime
- [ ] Zero critical security issues

## Next Phase

Upon successful completion of Phase 1, we will proceed to Phase 2: Mainnet Preparation, focusing on:
- Security audits
- Performance optimization
- Governance implementation
- Economic model finalization
