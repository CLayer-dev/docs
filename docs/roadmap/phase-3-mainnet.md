# Phase 3 - Mainnet Launch

## Overview

Phase 3 marks the culmination of CLayer's comprehensive development strategy with the launch of a production-ready, fully-featured blockchain network. After extensive testnet ecosystem development and security validation, we launch with a complete DeFi infrastructure and proven 50,000 TPS performance.

:::info Launch Philosophy
We launch only when our ecosystem is battle-tested, secure, and ready for global adoption. Quality and security take precedence over speed to market.
