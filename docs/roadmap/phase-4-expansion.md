# Phase 4 - Global Expansion & Innovation

## Overview

Phase 4 represents Core Layer's long-term vision for global expansion and innovation - this is future strategic planning, not current operations. These plans outline our aspirational goals for establishing market leadership after successful mainnet deployment and ecosystem maturity.

:::danger Future Vision Only
