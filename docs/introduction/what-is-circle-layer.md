# What is Circle Layer?

Circle Layer is a high-performance, EVM-compatible, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Layer 1 blockchain designed to power decentralized applications with low fees, fast transactions, and exceptional scalability. We're building a comprehensive ecosystem through strategic development phases, focusing on thorough testing and security before mainnet launch.

## Core Technology

Circle Layer combines several cutting-edge technologies to deliver a superior blockchain experience:

- **EVM Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Ethereum's virtual machine, allowing seamless migration of existing dApps
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Energy-efficient consensus mechanism with enhanced security
- **Standard EVM Security**: Proven security implementations across the network
- **Fast Performance**: 3-second block time with 1-3 second finality
- **Low Energy Usage**: 99.9% less energy consumption than Proof of Work

## Development Strategy

### Our Approach: Building Before Launching
Circle Layer follows a strategic 3-phase development approach:

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** (Current)
- 2,000 TPS testnet development
- DPoS consensus implementation
- EVM compatibility & developer tools

**Phase 2: Ecosystem Expansion**
- Native Bridge & DEX (4 trading pairs)
- iOS/Android wallets
- **Agentic AI security layer** (in development)
- 50,000 TPS optimization

**Phase 3: Mainnet Launch**
- Complete ecosystem development
- Security battle-tested
- Production-ready performance

### Network Infrastructure (READY FOR ACTIVATION)
- **RPC Endpoint**: https://rpc-testnet.circlelayer.com
- **WebSocket**: wss://138.197.184.207:8545
- **Block Explorer**: https://explorer-testnet.circlelayer.com/
- **Faucet**: https://faucet.circlelayer.com
-->

## Key Differentiators

### Performance Targets
- **Testnet Target**: 2,000 TPS with 3-second blocks
- **Mainnet Goal**: 50,000 TPS with sub-second finality
- **Development Status**: Building comprehensive ecosystem
- **Gas Efficiency**: Ultra-low fees with CLAYER token

### Security
- **DPoS Consensus**: Delegated Proof of Stake security model
- **Validator Requirements**: Minimum 5 active validators for network security
- **Staking**: 100,000 CLAYER minimum stake requirement
- **Burn Mechanism**: 25% from gas fees (maximum 1,000,000 CLAYER)

### Developer Experience
- **Full EVM Compatibility**: Same as other EVM blockchains
- **Standard Integration**: Works with Web3.js, Ethers.js, and existing tools
- **MetaMask Support**: Easy wallet configuration
- **Example Contracts**: 0xfCb4Ce5953dE22cbF04d015df88a3a9895E86bEB
