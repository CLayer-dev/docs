# What is Circle Layer?

Circle Layer is a high-performance, EVM-compatible, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Layer 1 blockchain designed to power decentralized applications with low fees, fast transactions, and exceptional scalability. The testnet is currently live with standard EVM security features and a robust validator network.

## Core Technology

Circle Layer combines several cutting-edge technologies to deliver a superior blockchain experience:

- **EVM Compatibility**: Full compatibility with Ethereum's virtual machine, allowing seamless migration of existing dApps
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Energy-efficient consensus mechanism with enhanced security
- **Standard EVM Security**: Proven security implementations across the network
- **Fast Performance**: 3-second block time with 1-3 second finality
- **Low Energy Usage**: 99.9% less energy consumption than Proof of Work

## Current Network Performance

### Live Testnet Metrics
- **Chain ID**: 28525
- **Currency**: CLAYER
- **Block Time**: 3 seconds (actual)
- **Transaction Finality**: 1-3 seconds (actual)
- **Network Uptime**: 99.95% (Last 30 days)
- **Consensus**: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

### Network Infrastructure
- **RPC Endpoint**: https://rpc-testnet.circlelayer.com
- **WebSocket**: wss://138.197.184.207:8545
- **Block Explorer**: https://explorer-testnet.circlelayer.com/
- **Faucet**: https://faucet.circlelayer.com

## Key Differentiators

### Performance
- **Current Block Time**: 3 seconds
- **Current Finality**: 1-3 seconds
- **Network Status**: Testnet Live
- **Gas Fees**: Starting from 0.000021 CLAYER

### Security
- **DPoS Consensus**: Delegated Proof of Stake security model
- **Validator Requirements**: Minimum 5 active validators for network security
- **Staking**: 100,000 CLAYER minimum stake requirement
- **Burn Mechanism**: 25% from gas fees (maximum 1,000,000 CLAYER)

### Developer Experience
- **Full EVM Compatibility**: Same as other EVM blockchains
- **Standard Integration**: Works with Web3.js, Ethers.js, and existing tools
- **MetaMask Support**: Easy wallet configuration
- **Example Contracts**: 0xfCb4Ce5953dE22cbF04d015df88a3a9895E86bEB

## Use Cases

Circle Layer testnet is particularly well-suited for:

1. **DeFi Applications**
   - Decentralized exchanges using CLAYER for gas
   - Lending platforms
   - Yield farming protocols
   - Token development and testing

2. **Smart Contract Development**
   - Contract deployment and testing
   - Gas optimization testing
   - Integration testing with CLAYER
   - Performance benchmarking

3. **dApp Development**
   - Frontend integration testing
   - Wallet integration
   - Transaction testing
   - User experience optimization
